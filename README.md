# ANPER

Anper is a framework for fast development/prototyping REST APIs with Node.js. It is built on top of Fastify uses TypeScript and Prisma. It is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use.

## Why?

I created Anper becasue I'm lazy.

I come from the PHP world and I have been using Symfony for a long time. On that side of 'things' there is a great thing called [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/) that makes it really easy to create REST APIs. 

I wanted to have something similar for Node.js since I am learning node I figured it would be a great way to go a bit deeper into Fastify and Prisma. I also was building my own API  with just Fastify and Prisma and I was getting tired of writing the same code over and over again. Maybe I simply got too used to API Platform, maybe I'm just lazy...

I dont like everything about API Platform, but I love how simple it is to create the enpoints and how easy it is to customize them.

So I took the copy machine... I mean the inspiration machine and created Anper.

Development is still in early stages and I have no idea if this will ever be used by anyone else. But I'm having fun and learning a lot.

I would advise for now to not use this in production, since I did not write a single test yet and I dont know what kind of performance impact it will have on large applications.

That being said, if you want to try it out and give me some feedback, please do so. 

## Dependencies

At the moment this only requires Fastify and Prisma.
